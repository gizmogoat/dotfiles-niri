# dotfiles-niri
Minimalistic, personal use, mostly vanilla dotfiles for Niri. Very loosely based upon ML4W's preset keybinds, leaning into Catppuccin Mocha color scheme.

Requires or uses:
- waybar (topbar)
- xwayland-satellite (XOrg app support)
- kitty (terminal)
- fuzzel (app launcher)
- swaylock (screen locker)
- swaybg (wallpaper)
- polkit-gnome (authentication popups)
- playerctl (media player keybinds)
- firefox 

You will want to change your monitor settings, wallpaper path, and other values in the config if you wish to use these dotfiles.
