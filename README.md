# dotfiles-niri
Minimalistic, personal use, mostly vanilla dotfiles for Niri. Very loosely based upon ML4W's preset keybinds, leaning into Catppuccin Mocha color scheme.

These dots are *not* very aesthetic. They're meant to be functional, featuring thin gaps and no corner rounding to maximize space given to applications. They lean into a common color scheme, but beyond that it is very function over form.

- fuzzel (app launcher)
- swaylock (screen locker)
- swaybg (wallpaper)

You will want to change your monitor settings, wallpaper path, and other values in the config if you wish to use these dotfiles.
